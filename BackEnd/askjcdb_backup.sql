The first Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia.\n\n**However, the first person to hold the title of *President* at SJC was Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr.**  His presidency began in 1972.\n\n[More on early history?] [Other presidents?]\n","Other presidents?","Okay, so you're looking for more information on SJC presidents.  Based on what you've provided, it seems there's some confusion.  The list you gave shows current or recent administrators, not a chronological list of *all* presidents.

Initially, it was led by Directors, not Presidents.\n\n\n**The first Director was Father Sofio Mandia.**\n\n\nFor a long time, it grew, adding courses and eventually becoming Saint Joseph College. The Benedictine Sisters played a big role in its development for many years.\n\n\n**Then, in 1972, things changed –  Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. became the first person to hold the title of President.**\n\n\nAfter that, Bishops took on the presidency for a while, leading to significant growth and the addition of many new programs and buildings.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","What is the history of school?","The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","What is the short history of school?","The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.).","What is the mission of SJC?","MISSION: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.","What is the vision of SJC?","VISION: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What are the goals of SJC?","GOALS: Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.).","Who is the first president of the school?","Saint Joseph College (small details: A Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation., vision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation., mission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society., goals: Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.).","Who is the first president of the school?","Saint Joseph College (small details: A Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation., vision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation., mission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society., goals: Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.).","What are the goals of school?","GOALS: Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Who is the first president?","Okay, so you're looking for information about Saint Joseph College's first president?

This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Overview of the school","**Saint Joseph College Information:**\n\n• **Details:** A Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n• **Vision:** Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n• **Mission:** We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n• **Goals:** Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T.

Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Short summary about the history","HISTORY: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature.

With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","What is the school's vision","VISION: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What is the school's vision","VISION: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What is the school's vision","VISION: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What is the school's vision","VISION: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What is the school's vision","Here’s what I found:\nSaint Joseph College envisions: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What is the school's vision","Here’s what I found:\nSaint Joseph College envisions: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.","What are the school's goals?","Saint Joseph College has the following goals: Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)

To design a program for our graduating students to immerse themselves in certain depressed areas of the community.\n\nLocated at Rosales Street, Tunga-tunga, Maasin City, Southern Leyte 6600, Philippines\n\nHistory: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress.

For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature.

Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Who is the first president?","Okay, so you're asking about the very first president of Saint Joseph College.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress.

In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Who is the current president of the school?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA).

School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities.

In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T.

The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

To design a program for our graduating students to immerse themselves in certain depressed areas of the community.\n\nLocated at Rosales Street, Tunga-tunga, Maasin City, Southern Leyte 6600, Philippines\n\nHistory: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000.

School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A.

In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A.

The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D.

The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T.

The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","who is the current school president?","Saint Joseph College Information:\nA Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.\n\nVision: Saint Joseph College, a Catholic School, envisions an evangelized and evangelizing community providing excellent integral education and involvement in social transformation.\n\nMission: We commit: to build the Saint Joseph College Educative Family (SJCEF) centered on Christ; to form every member into an integral human person imbued with the gospel values and equipped with excellent quality education; and to be an active agent in making a humane society.\n\nGoals: **Goal 1 (Related to Community / Family.)** To deepen the culture of love, respect and service among the members of SJCEF.

This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\n**Notable events of Saint Joseph College:**\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the\n\n**Saint Joseph College leadership information:**\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings.

In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place.

Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\n**Notable events of Saint Joseph College:**\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the\n\n**Saint Joseph College leadership information:**\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature.

Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","I want to travel the whole world, what department should I enroll?","Okay, so you want to travel the world!

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities.

It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.","Short summary about the history","Okay, here's a concise history of Saint Joseph College:\n\n• **Founded in 1928 as Instituto de San Jose by Bishop Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents.

Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev.

In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-08-31 16:07:21.785

It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-08-31 16:07:45.55

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-08-31 16:04:33.747

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte.

The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.)."}	2025-09-01 09:53:12.385

To design a program for our graduating students to immerse themselves in certain depressed areas of the community., address: Rosales Street, Tunga-tunga, Maasin City, Southern Leyte 6600, Philippines, history: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.)."}	2025-09-01 10:12:20.626

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B.

The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed.

The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.)."}	2025-09-01 10:17:13.115

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-01 13:26:34.89

The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-01 13:38:50.856

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928.

In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-01 13:56:44.733

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats.

With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-02 05:10:42.544

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-02 06:06:10.153

Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-02 06:15:36.59

To design a program for our graduating students to immerse themselves in certain depressed areas of the community.\n\nLocated at Rosales Street, Tunga-tunga, Maasin City, Southern Leyte 6600, Philippines\n\nHistory: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities.

The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-02 08:01:29.849

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials.

Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928.

Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place.

When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto.

The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin.

To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President.

The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-02 23:47:21.939

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte.

Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D.

It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

To design a program for our graduating students to immerse themselves in certain depressed areas of the community.\n\nLocated at Rosales Street, Tunga-tunga, Maasin City, Southern Leyte 6600, Philippines\n\nHistory: The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities.

Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 00:19:24.457

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev.

The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 00:20:50.441

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin.

Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed.

It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T.

In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 00:55:34.776

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President.

It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 00:56:13.185

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 01:04:12.937

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin.

This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities.

It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nSaint Joseph College leadership history:\nPresident with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.\n\nNotable events of Saint Joseph College:\nThe Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G.

The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 03:21:18.292

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President.

He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 03:33:43.691

Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature.

It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President."}	2025-09-03 03:34:00.943

2	A Catholic School in Maasin City providing excellent education and active involvement in social transformation.	The Founding Years\nSaint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D. (1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization. In June, 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.\nThe Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.\n\nFrom Instituto to College\nThe year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.\nThe outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopened in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.\nFrom then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB –General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.\n\nThe Quest for Quality and Excellence\nOn August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).\nIn 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.\nIn 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.\nIn 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.\nIn the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.\nIn 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils. Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).\n\nThe Emphasis on School’s Professionalism and Catholic Character\nIn 1998, Most Rev. Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD became the second Bishop of the Diocese of Maasin, a year after the death of Bishop Ataviado. He assumed the Presidency of the school in 2000. Since then a rapid growth and development of the school took place. Under his new leadership, the professional dimension of the school is pursued with vigor and its Catholic character given greater and renewed emphasis. He initiated reforms and innovations in organizations, operations, services, curricula, campus development and research.\nThis is the reason why before completing all the constructions of the school, the School President and at the same time the Bishop of Maasin dealt first with the formulation of the Vision, Mission, Goals of the School which would set the direction of the school which was professional, Christian and specifically Catholic in nature. Thus, in line with the School’s vision and mission, Bishop Cantillas created in 2001 the Theology Department with its own Dean to emphasize theology subjects as the core of everything the School is teaching to its college students who would now take theology subjects from first year to fourth year in college.\nMoreover, alongside with feeding the young minds with knowledge is feeding the young and innocent souls with the Word of God and the Body of Christ through daily class mass (in elementary, high school, and college) recollection, and retreats. For this purpose, the School President constructed a recollection/retreat center in Macrohon called Shalom and put up or renovated chapels in elementary, high school, college, and extension campuses.\nIn 2001, the government recognized the course Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim) whose enrollees grew in giant strides so that the School Administration decided to finish the fourth floor of the new college building. In 2002, the grade school program was conferred PAASCU Level II accredited status.\nIn 2003, to take care of the out of school youth, the School President with the help from abroad, constructed the Vocational Training Center (VOCTRAC) producing skilled youth ready to work in companies here and abroad. From just two courses (Automotive NC II and Welding NC II) in the beginning, the Center together with TESDA offers Electrical Technology (NC III), Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology (NC I), Consumer Electronics (NC II), Plumbing Technology (NC II), Computer Hardware Servicing (NC II), Short-Term Driving (NC II), Healthcare Services (NC II), Household Services (NC II), Housekeeping Services (NC II), and Bartending Services (NC II).\nIn 2007, the School offered Bachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA). The following year, the Administration Offices were transferred to the New College Building to give way to the construction of more classrooms for the High School students whose population increased rapidly.\nIn 2008, the Office of Planning and Research were established to articulate the School’s thrust towards research, service and development. School Year 2011-2012 marked the founding of the course Hotel and Restaurant Management occupying the fifth floor of the college building. The following year, the School inaugurated the Giuseppe Hotel and Restaurant and other HRM Facilities. St. Felicity and St. Rose of Lima Dormitories for female students were also blessed. Also this year, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) got recognition from the government.\nMindful of its social responsibility, the School established in 2012 the Community Extension Service Office to handle the outreach programs and activities for the needy communities. The five year management and development plan was implemented since 2013 after the School President’s approval.\nIn 2013, the third and fourth storeys of the new high school building where the additional classrooms, the new principal’s office, and the new library are located were blessed by the School President. This year also saw the recognition of the Bachelor of Science in Accounting Technology.\nIn 2014, the Office for Public Affairs, Publications, and Alumni Relations was created with the purpose of making further the School play a vital role in public life and events by coordinating and facilitating SJC’s relationships with the communities (local, provincial, and national government), the media and the general public.\nIn compliance in the year 2016 with the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act 10533), commonly known as the K to 12 Law which expanded the Philippines’ basic education to include a two-year senior high school (SHS) program, Saint Joseph College saw the rise of the new three-storey building in the middle campus at the back of the Maasin Cathedral to house the Senior High Students. Thus, the Godfrieda Covered Court and the wooden college building gave way to the new Senior High edifice and to the much bigger BGC or Bishop Cantillas Gym. With the influx of local and foreign tourists to the region and province of Southern Leyte, the School Administration opened a new course on tourism (BSTM) in year 2018.\nIn the academic year 2023-2024, with the rise of the demand for local professionals handling infrastructures, the School introduced BS Architecture to the delight of those who could not afford going outside the province or the region for the sought-after course.\nCommitment to Uphold the Mission in Synodality\nOn June 24, 2024, after twenty-five years, the Most Reverend Bishop of Maasin, Bishop Precioso D. Cantillas, SDB, DD, passed on the presidency to the Executive Vice President, Msgr. Oscar A. Cadayona, PhD, SThL-MA.\nOn August 1, 2024, the new head was formally installed as the 5th School President of Saint Joseph College. In his inauguration, the new School President presented his Ten-Point Scholastic Agenda to help realize the Vision, Mission, Goals of the Catholic Institution as it is geared to its centenary: Back to Basics, Practice What is Taught, De-Construct in the Classrooms, Change for the Better, Oblation for Greater Good, Aspiration for a Big Dream, Corresponsibility, Synodality, Job Security, and Continuity (or BPDC-OAC-SJC Agenda).\nThe same academic year 2024-2025 saw the approval of the new courses by CHED: A.B. Political Science and Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The first medical course of the school was given its home in the new building which rose from the ruins of the carpentry shop beside the Cathedral. The ground floor served as the dormition chapel and columbarium of the Diocese of Maasin. The second floor until the fourth floor housed the nursing laboratories, classrooms, and the new and modern SJC Library. To date the school’s physical plant and facilities have greatly improved.\nAdditional structures such as the Bp. Ataviado Hall, Bp. Hacbang Gym, Bp. Cantillas Gym, Msgr. Mandia Gym, the new four-storey Junior High building, the new three-storey Senior High building, the four-storey Nursing building, the five-storey College building replacing old wooden Benedictine Sisters’ Convent, and the ladies dormitories continued to rise at the main Tunga-tunga campus.\nAlso, SJC Mambajao Campus saw the following: an old Engineering building got refurbished to welcome Architecture students; the VOCTRAC got expanded with second floors to house various vocational/TESDA short courses; and the hostels once built for the Guinsaugon orphans got renovated and converted to male student-dormitories.\nFurthermore, modern facilities to enrich development-oriented courses in arts, education, sciences and business have been installed. To name a few, SJC has fully equipped and air-conditioned computer and speech laboratories and fully furnished audio-visual room. It is equipped with basic science laboratories in Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a simple but workable laboratory for civil engineering and architectural experiments.\nThus, Saint Joseph College has gone a long way from what it was when it was founded in 1928. Its growth has been largely due to the coordinated efforts and dedication of the administration, faculty, studentry, non-academic personnel, alumni, the community and its generous benefactors from other countries and within the country.\n\nThe first two heads of the Institution were called Director/Directress. Mgr. Sofio Mandia was the first head and followed by Sr. Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB. It was only in 1972 that the head was formally called School President. Mr. Marcelino Hanopool was considered as the 1st School President. His term lasted until 1978. Bishop Vicente T. Ataviado, Chairman of the Board, assumed the presidency, and thus became the 2nd School President from 1978 until 1995. After 1 years, Bishop Ataviado retired and appointed the 3rd School President, Sr. Anthony Kuizon, OSF. In 1999, Bishop Cantillas, the new Chairman of the Board, upon his installation as the Bishop of Maasin the year before, took the responsibility in leading the institution as the 4th School President.
